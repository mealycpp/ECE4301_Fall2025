# Objective

Benchmark cryptographic performance on the **Raspberry Pi 5** to evaluate:
- **Execution time**, **throughput**, and **latency**  
- How the **crypto engine cooperates with the OS scheduler and CPU**

Algorithms tested:
- AES-128  
- AES-256  
- SHA-256  
- SHA-512  

---

## System Setup
- **Board:** Raspberry Pi 5 (Debian 12 Bookworm 64-bit)  
- **Libraries:** OpenSSL 3.5.1  
- **Tools:** Python 3 (venv + Matplotlib + Pandas), `perf`, `openssl speed`  
- **Crypto engine:** Linux Crypto API + OS scheduler cooperation (see diagram below)

## How the Crypto Engine Cooperates with the OS Scheduler and CPU

1. The CPU triggers crypto operations through the kernel driver (Linux Crypto API).  
2. The OS configures DMA buffers and starts the crypto engine.  
3. The engine executes independently, freeing the CPU for other tasks.  
4. The OS scheduler allocates CPU time to other threads while the engine runs.  
5. When the operation finishes, an **interrupt** notifies the kernel, which wakes the waiting process.

## How to Run the Benchmark Script

### 1. Run the full benchmark pipeline
```bash
# Clone or navigate into your project
cd ~/ECE4301_Fall2025/benchmarks_aes_only

# Make the script executable
chmod +x run_benchmarks.sh

# Execute
./run_benchmarks.sh


source venv/bin/activate
python parse_openssl.py
python plot_benchmarks.py


## ðŸ§© Observation

The **crypto engine** demonstrates strong parallelism between the CPU and the hardware accelerator.  
When a cryptographic operation is requested, the **CPU dispatches the task** to the engine through the kernel driver.  
While the **crypto engine processes data independently**, **DMA** (Direct Memory Access) and **interrupt-driven communication** allow the CPU to continue other tasks â€” achieving **non-blocking execution**.  

Among the tested algorithms, **AES-128 and AES-256** achieved the best balance of **throughput** and **latency**, clearly outperforming SHA-based operations in both efficiency and response time on the **Raspberry Pi 5**.
