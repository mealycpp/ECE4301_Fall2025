# AES Demo â€” Raspberry Pi 5 Crypto Engine vs CPU

This folder contains the demo materials and source code used for **ECE 4301 â€“ Quiz #1**  
to benchmark AES-128 encryption performance on the Raspberry Pi 5 hardware crypto engine  
versus a standard CPU software implementation.

## ðŸ§° Prerequisites (on Raspberry Pi 5)

Before running, ensure your Pi 5 is set up with Rust and required tools:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install clang perf
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
rustup toolchain install nightly

Instructions For Runninf Haedware AES Demo (main_hw.rs) 

cargo new aes_hw_demo
cd aes_hw_demo

cp /path/to/demo/main_hw.rs src/main.rs

RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=cortex-a76 -C target-feature=+neon,+crypto" cargo +nightly build --release
./target/release/aes_hw_demo

perf stat ./target/release/aes_hw_demo > hw_perf.txt 2>&1

Instructions For Running CPU AES Demo (main_cpu.rs)

cargo new aes_cpu_demo
cd aes_cpu_demo

cp /path/to/demo/main_cpu.rs src/main.rs

cargo +nightly build --release
./target/release/aes_cpu_demo

perf stat ./target/release/aes_cpu_demo > cpu_perf.txt 2>&1


Notes

The hardware version uses ARMv8 NEON + AES intrinsics available on Pi 5.

The CPU version executes equivalent AES rounds purely in software.

For full reproducibility, use Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm 64-bit or newer.

Output logs (*_out.txt, *_perf.txt) can be compared for timing and CPU utilization.
