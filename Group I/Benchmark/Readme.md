1) Encrypting the message "Hi this is plain text" (21 bytes) and displaying the execution time, throughput, and total Latency using the specific encryption method. Since the message was only 21 bytes, the message used a block size of 21 Bytes with the Crypto Extension, as using anything larger would not have increased the speed of encryption.
2) Running the specific encryption method for 3 seconds using block sizes of 16 kB as to reference it to the speed test done by doing "openssl speed -evp aes-256-gcm" in the terminal. (SHA-256 in this case). This time the number of Bytes processed, throughput, and Latency per 16 kB block is displayed.
3) Power consumption (W) was considered as a benchmark, but we were unable to reproduce consistent results, which may be the result of things like background applications or the fan in the PI 5's case spinning at various speeds. Notably, the pure software Rust version had the lowest power consumption when run in the terminal. The Crypto Extension on .py had the second-highest consumption, and using Rust Analyzer run/debug in VS Code had the highest power consumption by a wider margin of around 1-2 watts.

Examining the benchmark Excel file in this directory, we can see that the Crypto Extension can increase the speed of operations by several orders of magnitude for both the simple message and the 3-second 16 kB block size test for all methods of encryption.
